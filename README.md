# Level UP: Leaps-and-Bounds Edition
Level Up is a platform game whose difficulty increases with each level. 
 
#About
Each level in Level Up increases in difficulty and altitude. Level up begins at Sea Level, and the player, a crab, 
has to use seashell platforms to collect coins. Once the player collects 4 coins the game goes to the next level. 
The second level is the Mountain Level. Here the player, a human, has to use the moving hill platforms to reach a coin 
that leads to the last level. The 3rd level is in space, and the player has to leap to collect 30 stars in order to win.
